## Hi there 👋 I'm Rebecca

With over five years of experience in the FinTech industry, I have honed my skills in analyzing complex datasets, architecting scalable data models, and streamlining business processes for various cross-functional teams in departments such as Banking Operations, Anti-Financial Crime, Customer Risk, Payroll, and HR. My technical proficiency includes, but is not limited to, Python for scripting and automation, SQL for database management, DBT for data transformations, and Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines. I also have hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, Snowplow for event tracking, and Amazon Redshift and AWS S3 for cloud data storage solutions.

Additionally, I am skilled in leveraging Microsoft Excel and Power BI for financial analysis and reporting, as well as BigQuery and Tableau for advanced analytics and data visualization. My ability to integrate these technologies allows me to build efficient, reliable, and scalable data systems that meet the demands of fast-paced FinTech environments.

📅 From December 2023 to June 2024, I held a management role focused on training and leading a team of five data analysts in a time-sensitive, six-month data mapping and migration project. During this period, my primary tech stack was Microsoft Excel, and I was not actively creating or posting projects on GitHub.

🤿 From July 2024 - November 2024 I was in Malta completing a three month PADI Divemaster course. 

🔍 I am currently searching for a new opportunity & am open for work.


🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project that involves random generation of writing prompts. Using SQLite and Python, the script pulls from an internal database. The database contains a variety of prompts categorized by genre, subject, and word count. The script randomly selects a prompt and presents it to the user each day, encouraging consistent daily writing practice.

  
🌱 I’m currently enrolled in two courses:
    - [DataExpert.io Free Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.techcreator.io/)   
    - [Gotham Writers' Memoir Writing I](https://wp.writingclasses.com/courses/memoir-writing-i/)
