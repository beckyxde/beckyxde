## Hi there 👋 I'm Rebecca

👩‍💻 Data Analyst with 6+ years of experience in the FinTech sector, specializing in big data analytics, dashboard development, and process automation. Skilled in technical writing and SOPs, with a strong passion for sharing knowledge and empowering non-technical stakeholders.

📅 In 2024, I led a team of ananlysts in a six-month data mapping and migration project. During this period, my primary tech stack was Microsoft Excel and Power BI for analysis and reporting, and I was not active on GitHub. 

My technical understanding and tech stack include the following:  
    - Python for scripting and automation (especially with Google Sheets & Microsoft Excel integration)  
    - Developing SQL queries for both data analysis & database management  
    - Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration  
    - Amazon Redshift and AWS S3 for cloud data storage solutions  
    - Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines creation and management
