## Hi there üëã I'm Rebecca

## üîç I am currently searching for a new opportunity.

With over five years of experience in the FinTech industry, I have honed my skills in analyzing complex datasets, dashboard creation, and automating reporting processes, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. With a strong foundation in finance and data governance, I'm passionate about technical writing, documentation, and sharing knowledge to empower employees in non-technical roles. Departments that I've worked closely with are Banking Operations, Anti-Financial Crimes, Customer Risk, Payroll, and HR. 

üìÖ From December 2023 to June 2024, I held a management role focused on training and leading a team of five data analysts in a time-sensitive, six-month data mapping and migration project. During this period, my primary tech stack was Microsoft Excel and Power BI for financial analysis and reporting, and I was not actively creating or posting projects on GitHub.

ü§ø From July 2024 - November 2024 I was in Malta completing a three month PADI Divemaster course and gaining hands-on experience in the diving industry. 

My technical understanding and tech stack include the following:  
    - Python for scripting and automation (especially with Google Sheets & Microsoft Excel integration)  
    - Developing SQL queries for both data analysis & database management  
    - Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration  
    - Amazon Redshift and AWS S3 for cloud data storage solutions  
    - Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines creation and management
