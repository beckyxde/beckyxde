## Hi there üëã I'm Rebecca

## üîç I am currently searching for a new opportunity.

Data Analyst with 6+ years of experience in the FinTech sector, specializing in big data analytics, dashboard development, and process optimization through
automation scripting. Skilled in technical writing and documentation, with a strong passion for empowering non-technical stakeholders.

üìÖ From December 2023 to June 2024, I held a management role focused on training and leading a team of five data analysts in a time-sensitive, six-month data mapping and migration project. During this period, my primary tech stack was Microsoft Excel and Power BI for financial analysis and reporting, and I was not actively creating or posting projects on GitHub. 
ü§ø From July 2024 - November 2024 I was in Malta completing a three month PADI Divemaster course and gaining hands-on experience in the diving industry. 

My technical understanding and tech stack include the following:  
    - Python for scripting and automation (especially with Google Sheets & Microsoft Excel integration)  
    - Developing SQL queries for both data analysis & database management  
    - Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration  
    - Amazon Redshift and AWS S3 for cloud data storage solutions  
    - Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines creation and management
