## Hi there 👋 I'm Rebecca

## 🔍 I am currently searching for a new opportunity & am open for work.

With over five years of experience in the FinTech industry, I have honed my skills in analyzing complex datasets, dashboard creation, and streamlining business processes for various cross-functional teams. Departments that I've worked closely with are Banking Operations, Anti-Financial Crimes, Customer Risk, Payroll, and HR. 

My technical understanding and tech stack include the following:  
    - Python for scripting and automation (especially with Google Sheets & Microsoft Excel integration)  
    - Developing SQL queries for both data analysis & database management  
    - Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration  
    - Amazon Redshift and AWS S3 for cloud data storage solutions  
    - Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines creation and management  

📅 From December 2023 to June 2024, I held a management role focused on training and leading a team of five data analysts in a time-sensitive, six-month data mapping and migration project. During this period, my primary tech stack was Microsoft Excel and Power BI for financial analysis and reporting, and I was not actively creating or posting projects on GitHub.

🤿 From July 2024 - November 2024 I was in Malta completing a three month PADI Divemaster course. 

🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project that involves random generation of writing prompts to encourage consistent daily writing. Using SQLite, Python, and the Google Drive API, the script pulls values from an internal database, and outputs a daily writing prompt and cooresponding date into a new word document. Similarly to a themed daily journal entry. If the word document is blank by the next script run, the blank document will receive a new prompt (this is to avoid blank document buildup in my Gdrive).

🌱 I’m currently enrolled in two courses:   
    - [DataExpert.io Free Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.techcreator.io/)   
    - [Gotham Writers' Memoir Writing I](https://wp.writingclasses.com/courses/memoir-writing-i/)
